> Easy to use but yet powerful iOS App built to make light metering just simple and effective.

This app is a light meter designed for simplicity and easy to use. It offers you multiple time aperture combinations at once that match your scene. Just dial in your ISO and the matching exposure values are displayed. You can highlight your favourite time and aperture which makes the reading even faster, since your eye is lead to the matching exposure.

The light meter offers an auto exposure mode that uses the great Apple camera exposure algorithm, or you just touch into your scene for spot measurement. In spot meter mode the exposure is locked and you can make your reading or investigate the scene for over and underestimations.
