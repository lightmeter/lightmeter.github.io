## Ãœbersicht

The goal of the user interface is to have a very simple user interface with basic to none user interactions for the measurement. For this reaason the only important setting is the ISO. Also only full stop aperture values are displayed. So if you'Re missing your 1.7 or 1.8 or 3.5 they were left away in order to make the user interface less distracting.

1. Displays the exposure value of the last measurement. In simple words it is a number that represents the current ammount of light. Or a bit deeper look on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value). This number does real magic if your time is set to the ISO read more later.

2. This is a textual representation that is associated with the exposure value. This is often referred to as Sunny 16 rule. Although you likely know what scene you're currently measuring, the text helps you to remember a small sentece and a more abstract number.

3. The all important ISO setting. Just touch the ISO setting of your current film or a bit higher if you're going to push the film. This setting is the *only* important setting. All other settings are automatically calculated for you.

4. The time scale. It moves with the current measurement. You can select one of time settings so it will be visualized. I often set it to the focal lenght of my camera. E.g. for my 40mm lense rangefinder I select 60, so it gives me a visual hint of when I will risk blurry images through camera shake.

5. The aperture scale. It moves just like te time scale with the current management. Also an apperture can be set here. I often select the minimal apertue. E.g. on my 1.7 range finder I'd select the 2.0 field.

6. The measure button. Press to make continuous readings. Press again, will stop the camera and show you the last measurement taken.
Hint: The camera consumes batttery life, so better stop reading when done.

For reading just use combinations that are above each other. If you inspect the image above you see the following valid exposure combinations and all of them lead to the very same exposure.

| Time |Aperture|
| ----:|--------|
| 4000 | 1.4    |
| 2000 | 2      |
| 1000 | **2.8**|
|  500 | 4      |
|  250 | 5.6    |
|  125 | 8      |
|**60**| 11     |
|   30 | 16     |
|   15 | 22     |
