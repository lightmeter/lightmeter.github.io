## Imprint and Disclaimer

### Content of the online publication

The author makes no guarantees whatsoever for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information provided. This applies also to links. Liability claims against the author regarding damage caused by the use or ignorance of any information provided, including any information which is incorrect or incomplete, are therefore excluded, insofar as there is no evidence of wilful intent or gross negligence on the part of the author. All offers are non-binding and without obligation. The author expressly reserves the right to edit, expand or delete sections of pages, or the entire publication, or to suspend publication temporarily or permanently, without separate announcement.

### References and links

The author shall not be liable for any content of third-party internet sites, which are referred to directly or indirectly from his pages by links and which are beyond his sphere of responsibility, unless it has full knowledge of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable to expect it to prevent use in the case of illegal content. Therefore, the author expressly declares that such sites accessed by links were free of illegal content at the time the links were created. The author has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design, or on the content of linked sites that are altered after the links have been created. This applies to all links on its own internet site, as well as to postings made by users of guest books, discussion boards or mailing lists provided. Only the provider of the internet site to which reference is made, and not the provider who merely refers to such a site by means of links, shall be liable for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content, and particularly for damage resulting from the use or ignorance of such information. Furthermore the author makes no guarantees whatsoever for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of information/services/products offered in such sites.
